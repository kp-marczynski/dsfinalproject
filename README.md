This day, we embark upon a journey to foretell the destinies of those who dabble in the magicks of storms. We have neither friend nor mentor to guide is this quest. We must first seek the Holy XGB and from there venture onwards to Overflowings of Stacks. Stand strong, brethren, for the Python’s approach. We will persevere through this mission. We must accomplish our tasks ere a fortnight has passed or doom our quest to failure. I bid thee farewell and pray for a swift training. - Di’Ma’Ki; The Third Age, Caramanis Cycle</i>

This is where our data science final project goes. Maybe we'll stick a description here later.
